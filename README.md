# Going Running (beets plugin)

*A [beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets) plugin for insane obsessive-compulsive music geeks.*

The *beets-goingrunning* plugin is for runners. It lets you configure different training activities by filtering 
songs based on their speed(bpm) and duration and attempts to create a list of songs for that training.


## Installation
The plugin can be installed via:

```shell script
$ pip install beets-goingrunning
```
