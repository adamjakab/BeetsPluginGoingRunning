# This configuration file is used to test that the configuration values propagate from root down.
# That is to say, if a certain leaf does not have a configuration value it should inherit it from its parent.
# In this configuration file values on "training-1" are missing (only alias is given as a placeholder) so
# values from "trainings" should be applied.
